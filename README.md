## Welcome to my Profile! ðŸ‘‹

### My name is **Noah Arsala** and I am a second year ***Software Engineering*** student at **UC Irvine**!

I am from Elk Grove, California!

I have a huge interest in web/app development, and I mostly have focused on front end work throughout my periods of working on projects. However, I am very interested in backend as well. I actually am learning/practicing full stack team-based development by working with [Commit the Change at UC Irvine](https://github.com/ctc-uci) as a **project developer!**

Currently, I am working with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Reactnative on my projects.

### I am always open to making new friends and connections in this field!
If you're interested in connecting, you're more than welcome to get in touch with me on [Linkedin!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-arsala-0324911b3/)
